I am a graduate student at New York University's Tandon School of Engineering, pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science. I also hold a Bachelor of Science from NYU, with majors in Mathematics and Computer Science. My research interests span Computer Vision, Information Security, and Robotic-assisted Surgery. At the Flexible AI-enabled Mechatronic Systems Lab, I am part of the contactless robotic team, working on enhancing depth perception for lung tumor detection in vision-enabled robotic surgeries. I am passionate about applying machine learning to solve real-world problems.
